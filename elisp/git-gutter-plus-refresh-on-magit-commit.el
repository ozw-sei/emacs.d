;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package provides a hack to refresh git-gutter+ in open
;; project-buffers after an interactive commit via magit.
;;
;; This behavior appears to have been supported by git-gutter+ at some
;; time, but the project has not seen active development in some time and it is possible
;; that a more-recent version of magit broke this functionality.
;;
;; As such, this code does not belong here but rather pushed upstream.
;; It is my intent to push this code upstream after some additional
;; optimizations are derived for performance.
;;
;; Thanks for your understanding, patience and help making it so!

;;; Code:

(defun git-gutter+-refresh-all-saved-buffers ()
  "Refresh git-gutter+ on open project-buffers.

This function is called automatically by `git-commit-post-finish-hook'."
  (interactive)
  (let ((project-files (projectile-current-project-files)))
    (dolist (file-to-refresh project-files)
      (let ((buffer (get-file-buffer (concat (projectile-project-root) file-to-refresh))))
        (when buffer
          (message "Refreshing git-gutter+ in buffer '%s'" buffer)
          (with-current-buffer buffer
            (git-gutter+-refresh)))))))
