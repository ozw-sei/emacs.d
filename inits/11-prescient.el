;; Prescient configuration disabled due to loading issues
;; If prescient causes problems, this file disables it completely

;; Vertico + Orderless provide excellent completion without prescient

;; To use this instead of the main prescient config:
;; 1. mv 11-prescient.el 11-prescient.el.original
;; 2. mv 11-prescient.el.disabled 11-prescient.el

;; No prescient configuration - rely on Vertico's built-in history
;; and Orderless for filtering, which work excellently together
